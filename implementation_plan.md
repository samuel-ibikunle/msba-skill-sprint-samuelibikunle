What does this repo do in plain language?
This repository analyzes an e-commerce sales dataset in a Google Colab notebook and produces summary insights and interactive visualizations to help understand sales performance and trends.

What would you need to change to use it for a real company?

Replace the sample CSV with the company’s real data source and automate the refresh.

Clean up and standardize column names, data types, and missing-value rules to match the company’s definitions.

Add access controls for sensitive data and write outputs to a shared location not just notebook charts.
