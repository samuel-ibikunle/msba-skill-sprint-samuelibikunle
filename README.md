This repo is my skill sprint on building an interactive analytics dashboard in a reproducible Google Colab notebook using e-commerce sales data.  
The Original repo cloned is from - https://github.com/Indra1806/Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard  
I chose this topic because interactive dashboards are a practical analytics skill for quickly exploring KPIs and communicating results to stakeholders.
